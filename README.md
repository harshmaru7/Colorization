## Colorization of B/W images using Deep learning

### Abstract

* Given a grayscale (black and white) image as input, we shall attack the problem of
hallucinating a plausible color version of the photograph.The problem we want to solve is a
fully automatic approach to colorization devoid of any human interference. This project will also compare performances of different models and existing papers .



### Highlights 
- Each pixel is assigned a color from the appropriate region using a
neighborhood matching metric, combined with spatial filtering for improved
spatial coherence .
- Pixels with a sufficiently high confidence level are provided as
“micro-scribbles” to the optimization-based colorization algorithm of Levin et
al. [LLW04 ] .
- Performance analysis over (a neural network model,a CNN model , auto encoder model and an
encoder-decoder classifier) .
